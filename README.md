Students often want to make some of their files available to other mates. Those
are often connected to the same residence hall network and FTP is a quick and
universal solution (browser support). Unforturnately, unlike specific file
sharing software, such an FTP client/server infrastructure lacks the search
function and finding content is often hard.

Enter porygon, a simple Python program that comes with a scanner, an indexer
and a Flask app as the search frontend.
