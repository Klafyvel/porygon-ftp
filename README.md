Students often want to make some of their files available to other mates. Those
are also often connected to the same residence hall network and FTP is a quick
and quite universal solution (FileZilla as server and a browser as client).
Unfortunately, unlike specific file sharing software, such an FTP
client/server infrastructure lacks the search function and finding content is
often hard because everybody has its own way of (not) keeping their file
hierarchy clean and organized.

Enter **porygon**, a set of simple Python programs, coming with a scanner, an
indexer and a Flask app as the search frontend. Find what you're looking for in
a matter of seconds! (disclaimer: actual file retrieval time may depend on
bandwidth and other factors)
